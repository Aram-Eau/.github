## AramEau Org

### Introduction 

Aram Eau (or AramEau all toghether) is the namespace for my personal projects, I wanted to use this instead of my personal account just in case I ever need to add collaborators (thus teams / projects / roles / etc...) because my personal account is currently just for private repositories.

### Projects

* Word Randomizer
* CLI
* SCPUP
* EauMaterial
* EauIcons
* EauDashboard

### About

AramEau is not only the namespace for my personal projects but it is also the name of my company, which sells handicrafts, and many other things. The first and only branch is located in Tequisquiapan and we currently don't support shipping, but we accept credit/debit cards, lol.

Also `arameau` is the name of my npm organization, which will be used to publish my npm packages/utilities. And also my gamertag in Steam. If anyone sees this and is interested in playing with me, send me a friend request (My account name is `ivanaram` but my visible name is `Aram Eau`). I usually play Brawlhalla but I also play other games like Overcooked2, Cuphead, Fall Guys, Cult of the Lamb, Risk of Rain, Dead Cells, among others. Maybe I'll create a Twitch account for this org, where I would stream all the games I play alone (or with AramEau Org's team members).
