## AramEau Org

### Introduction 

Aram Eau (or AramEau all toghether) is the namespace for my personal projects, I wanted to use this instead of my personal account just in case I ever need to add collaborators (thus teams / projects / roles / etc...) because my personal account is currently just for private repositories.

### Projects

* Word Randomizer
* CLI
* SCPUP
* Morfeo's Component Library
* Morfeo's Showcase

### About

AramEau is not only the namespace for my personal projects but it is also the name of my company, which sells handicrafts (Haven't sold anything yet since I just recently started it but it will grow). The first and only branch is located in Tequisquiapan and we currently don't support shipping, but we accept credit/debit cards, lol.

Also `arameau` is the name of the npm organization, which will be used to publish my npm packages/utilities. At the moment I haven't created an organization in another package manager (i.e. pip) because I haven't found the need to do that but maybe in the future we will be publishing stuff to other package managers.

Last but not least, Aram Eau is also my gamertag in Steam. If anyone sees this and is interested in playing with me, send me a friend request (My account name is `ivanaram` but my visible name is `Aram Eau`). I usually play Brawlhalla but I also play other games like Overcooked2, Cuphead, Fall Guys, Cult of the Lamb, Risk of Rain, Dead Cells, among others (if you are interested to see all the games I play visit my steam profile). May be I'll create a Twitch account for this org, where I would stream all the games I play alone (or with AramEau Org's team members).
